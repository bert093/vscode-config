A minimal and personalized Visual Studio Code setup focusing on the settings.json file. This configuration enhances the developer experience with customized editor preferences designed for consistency, performance, and productivity.

## 📦 What's Inside?
- ⚙️ settings.json – Tailored VS Code settings for an optimized development workflow

## 🔌 Required Extensions
To achieve the full visual and functional effect shown in the preview, please install the following extensions:
1. 🪟 [Glassit-VSC](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=s-nlf-fh.glassit) - Adds acrylic/glass-like transparency to the VS Code interface.
2. 🎨 [Custom UI Style](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=subframe7536.custom-ui-style) - Allows injecting custom CSS for a highly stylized look.
3. 🌀 [VSCode Animations](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrandonKirbyson.vscode-animations) - Adds smooth animations for UI interactions and transitions.

> ⚠️ Some extensions like Glassit-VSC and Custom UI Style require additional configuration and enabling custom CSS/JS. Make sure to follow their documentation carefully.

## 🔤 Required Fonts

To achieve the exact font rendering as seen in the preview, make sure the following fonts are installed on your system:
1. 🧬 Fira Code – [Download here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/FiraCode.zip) (for ligatures and modern code style)
2. 💻 JetBrains Mono – [Download here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/JetBrainsMono.zip) (excellent readability and aesthetics)
3. 🔡 Source Code Pro Nerd Font – [Download here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/SourceCodePro.zip) (Adobe’s developer font, patched with Nerd Font glyphs)
4. 📝 Roboto Mono Nerd Font – [Download here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/RobotoMono.zip) (Clean and modern monospace, patched with icons)
> 💡 You can select your preferred font via the editor.fontFamily setting inside settings.json.

## 🎨 Optional Theme

For a more visually refined and modern look (as seen in the preview), you may optionally use the Anyshphere Modern theme:
1. Anyshphere Modern - [Download here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GustavoPrietodePaula.anysphere-modern) “This is the theme I use daily for coding. It offers a clean, elegant aesthetic with soft syntax colors that reduce eye strain and keep me focused.”

## 🖼️ Optional Wallpaper

To complete the overall aesthetic, I also use a custom wallpaper that blends well with the transparent VS Code setup:
1. 🧊 [Aurora Dotfiles Hyprland](https://github.com/flickowoa/dotfiles/tree/aurora/config/hypr/wallpapers)
> 💡 This is the wallpaper I currently use with my VS Code theme. I discovered it from a Hyprland rice called [Aurora Dotfiles](https://github.com/flickowoa/dotfiles/tree/aurora), and it matches perfectly with the soft, bluish tones of the UI.
